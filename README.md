"# gymbox_auto_book" 

### How to run

Ensure you have `GYMBOX_EMAIL` and `GYMBOX_PASSWORD` defined as environment variables. This can be done with:
```
$ export GYMBOX_EMAIL=email
$ export GYMBOX_PASSWORD=password
```
Alternatively, the above statements can be added to your .bashrc (or equivalent, dependent on the shell you're using), so you don't need to re-export these for every new terminal session.

Once the above variables are set, you can run the script with:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
